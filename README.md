# Heart-Disease-Prediction
The heart model presumably did well with an accuracy score of 89% even though it was trained with a very little number of data. It can predict whether or not a person is prone to having a heart disease based on other independent clinical information.
I am so happy to have worked on this data as a trainee in CodeSquad LLC
I hope to continue as a medical student work on data like this and hopefully, one day be able to deploy some of these.
