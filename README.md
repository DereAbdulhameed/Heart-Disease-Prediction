# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This model is created to be able to predict whether or not a person is prone to having a heart disease or not based on several important clinical information.
I am so happy to have worked on this data as a trainee in CodeSquad LLC
I hope to continue as a medical student work on data like this and hopefully, one day be able to deplore some of these.
